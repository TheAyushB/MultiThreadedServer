# Java Multithreaded Web Server

This repository contains the code for a high-performance multithreaded web server implemented in Java.
## Overview

This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing fundamental Computer Science concepts, including:

* Operating Systems principles (Multithreading, Concurrency)
* Computer Networking (TCP/IP, Sockets, HTTP basics)
* Server Architecture

## Performance

Built for efficiency, this server has been tested to handle **over 1 million concurrent requests**. Performance benchmarks were conducted using **Apache JMeter**.

## Features

* Handles basic HTTP GET requests.
* Utilizes a thread pool for efficient request handling.
* Demonstrates core Java socket programming.
